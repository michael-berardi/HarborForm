# Liberty Design Studio

**We make beautiful websites and ad campaigns. But design is not the goal.**

Liberty Design Studio builds the digital systems underneath businesses that create pipeline, move deals forward, and produce measurable revenue. We focus on "Digital Engines" — high-performance web experiences tailored for Real Estate, Professional Services, SaaS, and eCommerce.

## Tech Stack

Built with a modern, performance-first stack:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Development

## Project Structure

- `/src/app` - App Router pages and layouts.
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components (Hero, Navigation, Footers, etc.).
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions, theme providers, and data constants.
- `/public` - Static assets (images, icons).

## Philosophy

"Busy does not equal productive. We measure work by outcomes that matter to the business. More qualified inquiries. Better follow-up. Faster time from first contact to signed agreement."
